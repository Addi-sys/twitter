# CoderSchool FTW - Twitter Group project

Created with love by: Marc, Juan Carlos, Dai, and MQ
  
We tried our best to recreate the Twitter feed page

The following **required** functionalities are completed:


    [x] The user should be able to enter a message into a text field.
    [x] The user should be able to press "Tweet" and see the message pop in below the text box.
    [x] The user should see a "count" that displays how many more characters the user has remaining, counting down from 140.
    [x] Upon tweeting, the characters remaining text should reset back to 140, and the field should be cleared.
    [ ] The application should disallow text of greater than 140 characters.
    [x] The user should be able to "Retweet". Clicking Retweet immediately inserts a copy of that tweet below the original tweet.
    [x] The user should be able to "Like". When "Like" is clicked, the text should change to "Unlike". When "Unlike" is clicked, the text should change to "Like". Alternatively, use a heart icon (colored or not colored).
    [x] When a "Liked" tweet is retweeted, the new tweet should not be liked.
    [ ] Each tweet has an optional hashtag. The hashtag should be linked with an anchor tag.
    [x] The user should be able to delete a tweet.


The following **optional** features are implemented:

    [ ] Users can mention other users. Any string that starts with @username will be highlighted in blue.
    [ ] The user can click on a hashtag, and only other tweets with that hashtag are shown.
    [ ] When the user deletes a tweet, all retweets should be deleted.
    [ ] Any tweet with an image URL will have the image automatically expanded in the tweet.
